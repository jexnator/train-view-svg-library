## About The Project

This library provides a collection of SVG icons and pictograms designed for visualizing wagons and wagon attributes of train formations in the Swiss public transport system. The library is actively used in the [Swiss Train Formation Visualization](https://opentdatach.github.io/train-formation-view/).

The SVG assets help represent wagons and wagon characteristics including class designations, accessibility features, onboard amenities, and vehicle types.
